						<h2>Press Release</h2>
						<p>“Tufts Game Design Team Announces TEMS vs. Drunk College Student”</p>
						<p>“Take on the role of a drunk college student who is trying NOT to get TEMsed!”</p>
						<p>On December 18th, a Tufts University Game Design team will release TEMS vs. Drunk College Student as a MAC and PC game. This unique top-down, first person shooter game can help you relive your Tufts college experience.</p>
						<p>Had one too many drinks and everything is a blur. You don’t know where your body is taking you and the academic quad looks like a maze. To make things worse, the entire TEMS department is after you. If you get caught, they’ll take you to the hospital against your will and you’ll end up with a fat, juicy medical bill at your front door. Moreover, the last thing you want is your reputation to become “that kid who got TEMsed.”</p>
						<p>Place yourself in the shoes of a drunk college student who is trying NOT to get TEMsed! As you navigate around the Tufts academic quad, avoid getting caught by a TEMs officer at all cost! Use your vomit powers to paralyze your opponents and be sure to pick up alcohol bottles for unique power-ups including, super-speed and teleportation!</p>

						<p>“This game allows me to vicariously live through . . .” -- ()</p>
						<p>“Simply Unreal.” -- ()</p>
						</p>Get ready for a one of a kind adventure that will last you a life-time.</p>
